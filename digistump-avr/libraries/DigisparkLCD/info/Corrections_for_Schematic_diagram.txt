Guide for connecting expander and generic 1602 display - bjornrasm:

    PCF8574       Display
    ---------------------
    P0            RS
    P1            RW
    P2            E
    P3            Backlight
    P4            D4
    P5            D5
    P6            D6
    P7            D7

Since not all PCF8574 packages have the same pin-layout,
I've not included them in the table above.

Note that this is completely different what is shown in the
schematic diagram, but this will work for generic components.

The T1 transistor driving the backligth drawn in the
diagram, shouldn't be a PNP type, but NPN! Most small signal
transistors will do, for example 2N2222.

I would move the R1 resistor from the emitter to the
collector (between collector and +5V). The value should
be like you use for ordinary LEDs (about 200-300 ohms) for
generic 1602 displays.
